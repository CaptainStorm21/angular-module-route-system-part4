        When you think of black sand beaches your mind immediately wanders to exotic, faraway lands. Perhaps the
        tropical Punaluʻu Beach of Hawaii or the icy Reynisfjara Beach in Iceland might be the first places you think of. But
        turn your attention a little further north and you’ll find these rare, coal-colored beaches exist right here on state
        shores. We already know the West Coast has plenty of natural wonders (including these incredible beaches) to
        explore and these two black sand stretches are just another testament to its boundless beauty. Discover this
        mesmerizing duo of black sand beaches without leaving California.
